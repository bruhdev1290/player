## How Android Auto Works

When users connect their Android device to an Android Auto compatible vehicle:

1. Android Auto detects Koel Player through the automotive app descriptor
2. The car's infotainment system displays Koel Player as an available media source
3. Users can browse their queue and recently played items
4. All playback controls work seamlessly (play, pause, skip, seek)
5. Album artwork and track information display on the car's screen
6. Voice commands like "Ok Google, play music" work automatically
7. Steering wheel controls integrate with the app
